EPS,1.1.4,Mexico Business-as-Usual (BAU) ,EPS_MX_Business-as-usual (BAU),company,"Energy Innovation, LLC",10/14/16,BAU/Reference,"The Mexico Business As Usual (BAU) scenario is a projection of what would happen if no new policies were to be enacted, and current policies were allowed to continue (or to expire) based on their existing legislative text.  It is not a prediction of what is likely to happen.  The scenario is based on very many data sources, but for energy use, the Mexican Ministry of Energy (SENER) is the most important source.  The purpose of the Energy Policy Simulator (EPS) is to predict how various packages of policies would change the future relative to the BAU case; for the most part, it does not project its own BAU case from scratch.  Therefore, the EPS BAU scenario is best used as a basis for comparison with other EPS scenarios.  This scenario is based on EPS version 1.1.4.  For more details about this scenario, for full documentation of the EPS, or to download a copy for yourself (free and open source), please visit https://energypolicy.solutions.",North America,Mexico,"buildings (residential and commercial); electricity; industry and industrial processes; land-use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF); transportation",CO2; VOC; CO; Nox; PM10; PM25; Sox; BC; OC; CH4; N2O; F-gases,carbon tax,,CCS; distributed generation,,biomass; coal; geothermal; hydro; natural gas; nuclear; oil; solar pv; solar thermal; wind,2030,1-year,None,None,No,None,,Only looking at the effect of changes in fuel prices on GDP.
