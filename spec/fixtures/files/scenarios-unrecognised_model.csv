Scenario context,Category,What category does this scenario fit under?,Picklist,BAU/reference; NDCs; NDCs-Conditional; NDCs-Unconditional; Decarbonization; not specified,NDCs,
Scenario context,Purpose/Objective,What was the original purpose or objective of the scenario? Why was it created?,Text (Alphanumeric),,"The ""Paris - Increased ambition"" scenario Illustrates the potential implications of INDCs. In this scenario, parties meet their INDC targets until 2030 and adopt larger of either decarbonization rate implied by INDC or high minimum decarbonization rate from 2030-2100",
Scenario context,Description,What is a description of the scenario?,Text (Alphanumeric),,"In the Paris-Increased Ambition scenario assumes a higher minimum decarbonization rate (5% per year) beyond 2030. In other words, the Paris-Increased Ambition scenario assumes that countries continue to decarbonize their economies beyond 2030 with the same annual decarbonization rate that was required to achieve their INDCs between 2020 and 2030. However, if their decarbonization rate is below 5% per year, they instead follow the trajectory defined by that 5% rate. This minimum rate is consistent with the average decarbonization rate required by the E.U. and the U.S.A. to achieve their INDCs from 2020 to 2030",
